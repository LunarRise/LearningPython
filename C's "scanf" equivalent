C's "scanf" equivalent : input

#Exemple : if you use a string input for a age (number)
           and then you want to add "2" to your age
           you have to write : age = int(input("How old are you ?  "))
                               age = age + 2
                               print(age)
           
           if you don't do that, you'll have something like 
           [TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly]
